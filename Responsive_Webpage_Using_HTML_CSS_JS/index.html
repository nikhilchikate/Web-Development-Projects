                    new technologies and knowledge. This type of education will focus more on practical skills rather
                    than theoretical knowledge. It will include both classroom-based learning as well as job-oriented
                    education</p>

                college education. Online Universities will create classes sponsored by companies. These companies will
                direct the universities on the materials of the course. The company will then offer those who pass the
                course a job. This will created a skilled worked specifically for a position in a company. Teachers will
                take a backseat in these courses. Teachers will offer one-on-one help and help people work
                collaboratively. These teachers will be more of a guide then a true classroom teacher.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> I very strongly believe that students need to be shown practical
                applications of the concepts they are taught. For myself this is especially notable in mathematical
                applications. As teachers we need to not just show how to work through a problem: we need to show why it
                works and what it is useful for. Without something to apply the information to math is nothing more than
                a stream of numbers and formulas that students memorize for a specific test and then quickly forget. By
                demonstrating specific examples of applications the students will be able to retain some of the
                information easier and then adapt what they learn to other problems they encounter in the future.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Technology will be used to enhance learning, such as by providing regular tests to track comprehension
                and adapting learning accordingly.
